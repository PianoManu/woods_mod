		+ Added 1 item "moss_item", which is one of the basic items of the mod; can be obtained by punching mossy logs (small chance)

	Version 0.0.2 --- 03.01.2020
		
		+ Added 1 block "mossy_dirt", which is similar to grass blocks

		+ Added 2 decorative blocks "epidote_block" and "fire_opal_block" - no special use, except for decorative purposes
		+ Added 1 biome "wet_forest_biome"
			+ "fire_opal_ore" and "epidote_ore" are generated quite frequently
			+ Mossy oak trees (huge and normal) and birch trees are generated instead of normal vanilla trees
			+ "mossy_dirt" is generated near lakes
			+ "moss" is generated frequently similar to grass
		+ Added package "block" containing all still used files from "woods_blocks"
		+ Added basic loot tables and basic recipes, mainly using a dataGenerator 
		* Multiple parts of the file hierarchy have been revised
			- "woods_blocks" package has been deleted and got replaced by "block" - all still used files were copied
			- "ModStairs.java" is no longer used and got deleted
			- "woods_blocks/WoodsSapling.java" was largely rewritten
			* "WoodsMain.java" not longer contains all static RegistryEvent classes - each one got their own class inside the init-package
		X Added an item container "wooden_box" - but it's completely buggy in the moment
		# If you find bugs, let me know
		
	Version 0.0.3 --- 09.01.2020

		# If you find bugs, let me know
		
	Version 0.0.4 --- 24.01.2020
		+ Added grass slabs, dirt slabs, grass stairs, dirt stairs
		+ Grass slabs are now generated in Wet Forest biome to smooth the terrain
		X Grass slabs cannot be placed on top of each other to make a grass block, because I had problems with the models
		X Grass stairs have weird side textures, will be fixed later
		# If you find bugs, let me know
	====================================================
		Release 0.1.0 --- 24.01.2020 - Version 0.0.4
		Test Release
	====================================================
	
	Version 0.0.5 --- 26.01.2020
		+ Added medium_forest_lantern and large_forest_lantern, emitting 8 and 15 light level
		+ Added some drops and recipes
		+ Wet Forest biome is now generated in the normal Default-world type
		+ Woods ores are now generated in every biome
		+ Grass slabs are now generated in every biome containing grass, but this feature is still buggy
		* Moss is now rendered translucent
		* Grass Slabs now can be placed on top of each other, but double slab is still buggy (e.g. does not change to dirt, if any other solid block is built above, because they only have the model of the grass block)
		* Fixed textures of grass slab and grass stairs, also they got the grass overlay
		* Changed the model of all three forest lanterns, they're pretty fancy now (at least that's what I think :D )
		* Grass stairs now have a better model
		* Grass slabs and grass stairs now have in every biome the same texture as grass blocks
		X Grass stairs placed upside-down look weird, maybe I'll fix it later, if I get how to manage this
