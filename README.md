# woods_mod
A mod for Minecraft, consisting features themed in the forest. Whether you like to explore the vast lands of minecraft or just like to build and chill, you'll have fun with this mod. The greatest feature is that grass slabs and other slabs are generated at each block edge, making the landscape look much nicer. (*cough* I stole the idea from hea3ven's "Building Bricks"-mod for MC 1.10 *cough*). But there are many more things to discover and have fun with. Some of them are listed below. Have fun! 

- Adding 6 trees as mossy versions of vanilla trees alongside mossy-wood - blocks (logs, planks, stairs, slabs, fences and saplings)
- Adding 9 ores and 17 gems
- Adding 1 biome (Wet Forest) with moss, where the new trees can be found (moss is a basic crafting ingredient)
- Adding a nice generation feature: the terrain is smoother than normal, because grass- sand- gravel- and stone slabs are generated throughout the world
- Adding many more decorative things
